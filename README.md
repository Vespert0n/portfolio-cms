# Portfolio CMS
Portfolio CMS is designed to make it quick and easy to develop a portfolio website for you or your client. Unlike other content management systems such as [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/), Portfolio CMS is designed as a backend tool, allowing you to develop the front end however you want it.

Portfolio CMS hasn't been designed for people without web development experience. You code the front end of the website and then, rather than having to develop a back end for content management, you can simply install Portfolio CMS.

Portfolio CMS takes advantage of a variety of other tools:
* [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
* [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
* [CKEditor](http://ckeditor.com/)
* [KCFinder](http://kcfinder.sunhater.com/)

## The problem with Wordpress
Wordpress is a great CMS. Thousands of people use it including some huge companies such as [eBay](https://www.ebayinc.com/stories/news/) and [PlayStation](http://blog.us.playstation.com/). But Wordpress and many other content management systems are designed for blogging. Sure you can use it for other things and many people have. But it has always been a comprimise, relying on third party plugins and hiding the huge blogging capability under the carpet. Some artists like to maintain a blog and Wordpress works great for that. Others feel they have to use the blog tools and most just wish it would go away.

We're here to show you our work, not write about it.

Portfolio CMS is different. Portfolio CMS is firstly all about showcasing your art. Sure you can add a blog if you want. But only if you want. It isn't forced down your throat and you don't have to find somewhere to put it if you don't want it.
