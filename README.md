# Portfolio CMS
Portfolio CMS is designed to make it quick and easy to develop a portfolio website for you or your client. Unlike other content management systems such as Wordpress, Portfolio CMS is designed as a backend tool, allowing you to develop the front end however you want it.

Portfolio CMS hasn't been designed for people without web development experience. You code the front end of the website and then, rather than having to develop a back end for content management, you can simply install Portfolio CMS.

Portfolio CMS takes advantage of a variety of other tools:
* Bootstrap
* CKEditor
